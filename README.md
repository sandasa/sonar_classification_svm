# sonar_classification_svm
This code demonstrates a machine learning classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify sonar signals as either a rock or a mine. The model is trained and evaluated using the sonar dataset, and the results are visualized using various plots and metrics. The final model is then saved using pickle.
